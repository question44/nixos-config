# System context for NixOS `erebor` (flake target `moria`)

Last inspected: 2026-10-16. NixOS 26.05 is installed and currently booted
from the `nixos-root` subvolume. Initial NixOS boot and desktop checks passed,
and Fedora was subsequently verified intact from its firmware entry.

This document becomes the NixOS-side operational memory after the parallel
installation. Verify live state before acting and do not record passwords,
tokens, private keys, browser profiles, Wi-Fi credentials, or other secrets.
Keep it concise: retain only important information relevant now, and remove an
entry when it becomes obsolete, superseded, or no longer applies. Historical
changes belong in `SYSTEM_CHANGELOG.md`, not here.

## What belongs here

- Non-declarative runtime facts verified on this host.
- Intentional exceptions or manual state that cannot be expressed in the Nix
  flake/modules.
- External recovery locations, hardware quirks, and safe validation steps.
- Reusable, verified operational pitfalls and their prevention/recovery.

## What does not belong here

- Packages, service definitions, mount topology, bootloader settings, desktop
  configuration, or any other state that can be derived from the flake and
  modules. The repository is authoritative for those.
- Secrets or one-off command history.

## Reusable operational pitfalls

- The installed Nix CLI has `nix-command` disabled by default. Run flake
  commands as `nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' flake
  <subcommand>` (for example, `flake check`) unless the feature is enabled in
  the environment.
- A newly added kernel module is not found by default modprobe after a NixOS
  test activation because it searches `/run/booted-system/kernel-modules`.
  For a module built against the running kernel, load it with
  `modprobe --dirname /run/current-system/kernel-modules <module>`.
- NixOS libvirt copies qemu.conf through libvirtd-config.service at daemon
  startup. After changing its device ACL, restart libvirtd to load it;
  test activation alone leaves an already-running daemon on its old config.
- Windows Looking Glass IDD needs **Force indirect copy** on this UHD 770:
  direct transport produced missing strips/blocks even with full-frame copies.
  The guest registry workaround and recovery locations are in WINDOWS_VM.md.
